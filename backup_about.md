Welcome! I am a Research Engineer at <b> Hitachi Research & Development, Digital Solution Research Group, Bangalore </b> working on application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision with multiple publications and patents. In parallel, I am also an M.S Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, College of Computing Specializing on Interactive Intelligence and part of Lucy Labs under <a href="http://www.davidjoyner.net/">Prof. David Joyner</a>. Previously, I completed my bachelors at PESIT-BSC, Bangalore where I <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1504/1504.07865.pdf">worked</a> under guidence of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehanshusaha/"> Dr. Snehanshu Saha (APP CAIR BITS PILANI)</a> and <a href=""> Dr. Srikantamurthy </a>. 

Some of my past collaborators include <a href="https://manikandan-ravikiran.github.io/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-7">Prof. Vinay Namboodiri</a> (<a href="http://deltalab.iitk.ac.in/">DelTA Lab, IIT-K </a>), <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3hstff6">Prof. Gaurav Sharma </a>(<a href="http://grvsharma.com"> IIT-K and INRIA-THOTH, NEC Media Anlytics - USA</a>), <a href="http://www.satoh-lab.nii.ac.jp/"> Prof. Shinichi Satoh and Group </a>(National Institue of Informatics, Japan), <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments-and-groups/smart-data-knowledge-services/team-sds/"> Prof. Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed, Jorn Hees </a> of  DFKI Germany - Smart Data & Knowledge Services Group.

My research interests are broadly in large scale applications of artificial intelligence including Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My ultimate research goal is to develop and improve natural language processing with focus on the healthcare and educational applications.



Welcome! I am a Research Engineer at <b> Hitachi R&D, Bangalore </b> working on application of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in the areas of Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision over past four years with multiple publications and patents. In parallel, I am also an M.S Student in Computer Science at Georgia Tech, College of Computing specializing on Interactive Intelligence and part of Lucy Labs under <a href="http://www.davidjoyner.net/">Prof. David Joyner</a> . Previously, I completed my bachelors at PESIT-BSC, Bangalore where I <a href="https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1504/1504.07865.pdf">worked</a> under guidence of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/snehanshusaha/"> Dr. Snehanshu Saha (APP CAIR BITS PILANI)</a> and <a href=""> Dr. Srikantamurthy </a>. 

After my bachelors in 2015, as part of my research I was fortunate enough to collaboratively work with <a href="https://manikandan-ravikiran.github.io/publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-7">Prof. Vinay Namboodiri</a> (<a href="http://deltalab.iitk.ac.in/">DelTA Lab, IIT-K </a>) and <a href="https://tinyurl.com/y3hstff6">Prof. Gaurav Sharma </a>(<a href="http://grvsharma.com"> IIT-K and INRIA-THOTH, NEC Media Anlytics - USA</a>) for optimizing object detection pipeline, <a href="http://www.satoh-lab.nii.ac.jp/"> Prof. Shinichi Satoh and Group </a>(National Institue of Informatics, Japan) as part of <a href="https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/968a/da6f9cb9084f47c5276f738f8f819a7de12f.pdf">TRECVID</a>. Recently, I have collaborated with <a href="https://www.dfki.de/en/web/research/research-departments-and-groups/smart-data-knowledge-services/team-sds/"> Prof. Andreas Dengel, Sheraz Ahmed, Jorn Hees </a> of  DFKI Germany - Smart Data & Knowledge Services Group for my research activity involving organizing <a href="https://crossmodallearning.github.io/"> 1st Workshop on Crossmodal Learning and Applications</a>. 

My research interests are broadly in large scale applications of artificial intelligence including Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision. My ultimate research goal is to develop and improve natural language processing with focus on the healthcare and educational applications.
