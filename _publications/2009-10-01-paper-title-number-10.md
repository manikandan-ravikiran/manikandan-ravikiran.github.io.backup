excerpt: 'Object detection is a fundamental problem in com-puter vision with wide ranging applications, from image taggingand indexing to applications related to surviellance, autonomousvehicles,  and  robotics.  We  address  this  problem  by  proposing practical improvements to an existing state-of-the-art object de-tection method i.e. Single Shot Detector (SSD) in multiple stageswith focus on plurality of application level requirements. As thefirst contribution, we propose to improve performance efficiency by  automatically  selecting  the  scales  of  the  default  boxes.  Thescales  of  the  default  boxes  determine  the  absolute  size  of  theobjects  being  searched  for  at  different  layers  of  the  network,respectively, and hence are better off being tuned for the specificstatistics  of  the  object  and  the  current  data  under  inspection.As a second contribution, we focus on compressing the detectionmodel  to accommodate  it  for the  low  memory applications  with limited  compromise  in  accuracy.  As  a  third  contribution,  wefocus  on  reducing  computations  by  pruning  the  search  spaceusing  semantically-nearest  neighbor  images  from  the  training set.  We  show  the  advantages  of  these  contributions  throughquantitative evaluations of multiple state of the art datasets across multiple application domains with, the first one leads to improvedperformance, the second and third contribution pavying way forreduced  memory  requirement  and  higher  detection  speeds'
