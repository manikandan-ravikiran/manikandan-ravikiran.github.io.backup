excerpt: 'In this report, a production system (agent) to solve 3x3 Raven’s Progressive Matrices (RPM) (Raven, 1962) is presented (Figure 1b) . The developed agent solves 12/12 on Basic, 10/12 on Challenge sets and 6/12 across Test/Raven’s respectively. The report explains details on the incremental design of the solution, error analysis, efficiency, generality, cognitive connection and concludes with some implications on future work. Due to the complexity of some of the production rules, a detailed explanation is provided for them in appendix section 6.2. Also, a tutorial on how to easily understand the submissions in this report is presented in appendix section 5.1'
