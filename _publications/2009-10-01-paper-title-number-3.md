permalink: /publication/2009-10-01-paper-title-number-3
excerpt: 'This paper describes the system developed for the task of temporal information extraction from clinical narratives in
the context of the 2017 Clinical TempEval challenge. Clinical TempEval 2017 addressed the problem of temporal reasoning in the clinical domain by providing annotated clinical notes, pathology and radiology reports in line with Clinical TempEval challenges 2015/16, across two different evaluation phases focusing on cross
domain adaptation. Our team focused on
subtasks involving extractions of temporal spans and relations for which the developed systems showed average F-score
of 0.45 and 0.47 across the two phases of
evaluations.'
