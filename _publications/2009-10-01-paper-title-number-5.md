excerpt: 'In this paper we present our participation to
SemEval-2018 Task 8 subtasks 1 & 2 respectively. We developed Convolution Neural Network system for malware sentence classification (subtask 1) and Conditional Random
Fields system for malware token label prediction (subtask 2). We experimented with
couple of word embedding strategies, feature sets and achieved competitive performance across the two subtasks. Code is made
