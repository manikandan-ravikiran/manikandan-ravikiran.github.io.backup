excerpt: 'Object detection is a fundamental problem in computer vision with wide ranging applications, from image tagging and indexing to applications related to autonomous vehicles , and robotics. We address this problem by proposing practical improvements to an existing state-of-the-art object detection method i.e. Single Shot Detector (SSD). As a first contribution, we propose to automatically select the scales of the default boxes. The scales of the default boxes determine the absolute size of the objects being searched for at different layers of the network, respectively, and hence are better off being tuned for the specific statistics of the object and the current data under inspection. As a second contribution , we propose to prune the search space using semantically-nearest neighbor images from the training set. We show the advantages of the two contributions with quantitative and qualitative empirical results; while, the first one leads to improved performance, the second one provides a way to trade-off performance for higher detection speeds.'
