excerpt: 'We present in this paper the results and system developed for Activities in Extended Video (ActEv) task, which is a pilot task in TRECVID 2018. ActEV is an extension
of the annual TRECVID Surveillance Event Detection (SED) evaluation by adding a large
collection of multi-camera video data, both of simple and complex activities. We participated and submitted for both sub tasks of Activity detection and Activity-Object detection
respectively for which we developed multiple systems based using combination of standard
detector, tracker and trajectory with CNNâ€™s and LSTM. More specifically we divided system
for subtask 1 into two parts with a subsystem consisting of Faster-RCNN detector [17], Simple Online Realtime Tracker (SORT) [18] and plotted trajectories with a CNN for detecting
activities where notion of reference is key. For rest of the classes, we used an LSTM trained
with CNN features of localized activity regions. For subtask 2, we use the localization information obtained from Faster-RCNN and SORT tracker of subtask 1. With these in place, we
achieved a result of 0.977 among all of our runs.'
